After the java 1.8 version the Lambda Expression and Spring Api is introduced
Lambda is anonyomous function
and having no name
and no modifier
and no return type

() ->{
}

This is lambda

It reduces the lines of code
It sequential and parallel execution support
to call apis very effectively
and tow write more readable ,concise code

Only used with the functional interface
After the lambda expression introduced it also behaves as Functional programming
as an argument of methods we can also pass on the functions
public int sum(int a,int b)
{
return (a+b);
}
(int a,int b)->
{
return (a+b);
}

Rules for the lambda expression
-> body contains one lines then the curly braces are optional
-> Java compiler also inter pret the type of variable that passed in the arguments and
type is optional
e.g (a,b) -> {
    return (a+b);
}

e.g (str) -> str.length;
-> Functional Interface :
If the interface contains only one abstract method then it is Functional Interface

Lambda is used to implement functional interface
