Disadvantages of Servlets:
Servlets are very powerful, but writing complex web pages using only Servlets has drawbacks:
Difficult to Maintain (Mix of Java + HTML)
In Servlets, HTML is written inside out.println("<html> ... </html>"); statements.
This mixes presentation (HTML) with business logic (Java), making the code messy and hard to maintain.
Poor Separation of Concerns
Designers (UI/UX people) usually work with HTML/CSS, but Servlets require Java knowledge to modify even the UI.
Any small UI change needs Java code updates + recompilation.
Harder for Large Pages
Writing large HTML forms, tables, or templates inside Java code becomes lengthy, unreadable, and error-prone.

Not Scalable for Presentation Layer
For big applications with many pages, Servlets alone become too complex to handle both request processing and page rendering.

When to Use JSP
JSP (JavaServer Pages) was introduced to solve these servlet drawbacks.
You should use JSP when:
Focus is on Presentation/UI
JSP is better suited for writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with small embedded Java code (<% %> or JSTL/EL).

Need Separation of Concerns
Servlet = Controller (handles logic, request/response, DB calls).
JSP = View (renders output as HTML to the user).

Together, they follow MVC architecture.

Dynamic Web Pages
When the page content is mostly static HTML but with some dynamic values (e.g., username, product list, feedback results).
Ease of Maintenance
UI designers can edit JSP files directly (without needing to touch Java code).
Developers can keep business logic inside Servlets/Beans.
