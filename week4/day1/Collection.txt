Collection is nothing just data structure
It is useful for making applications

Data is most important part of program
Collection deals with arranging the data inside the main memory
that data will be used by Java program

Why collections are needed
The limatation of array is size as array is always fixed size
same array can not be modified 


Set in the unique objects should be there and programmer should write down code
unique and sorted so sorted collection is there

List is a collection of ordered elements
The elements will have numbers
Insert, add or delete based on indices
List can duplicate elements but the elements is ordered
It is Interface

ArrayList, LinkedList , Vector and Stack

Set will not have duplicates you cannot insert that same object arranging
It is not ordered but it will have unique 

SortedSet , HashSet and LinkedHashSet
TreeSet is used for faster searching in the SortedSet

Frequent searches in the Set

Queue follows FIFO structure 

Priority Queue, Dequeue -> ArrayDequeue

It will be stored on key and value pair
Map -> Sorted Map -> TreeMap
HashMap, LinkedHashMap and HashTable


The Collection ->>> List, Set and Queue are in java.util package
These Collection classes and interfaces are Generic -> object of any class
