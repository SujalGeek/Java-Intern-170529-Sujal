Spring AI is a project under the Spring ecosystem that provides a unified way to integrate AI models (LLMs) into Spring Boot applications.

It acts as a bridge between your Java app and different AI providers like:

Ollama (local models)
OpenAI (GPT models)
Vertex AI (Google)
Anthropic (Claude)
HuggingFace, etc.

You only need to change configurations, not your code, to switch models.
Core Components of Spring AI
a) ChatModel

The low-level interface representing the actual AI model backend.

Responsible for:

Sending prompts to the model

Receiving generated responses

Handling API communication

Each provider has its own ChatModel implementation:

OllamaChatModel

OpenAiChatModel

VertexAiGeminiChatModel

It directly connects with the LLM endpoint (local or cloud).

b) ChatClient

The developer-friendly abstraction built on top of ChatModel.
Provides a simple, fluent API for interaction.

Handles:
Message roles (system, user, assistant)
Prompt construction
Response parsing

You interact with the ChatClient, not directly with the model.


Layer		Role								Example
ChatClient	High-level interface to interact with AI			You use this in controllers
ChatModel	Low-level bridge that sends requests to the actual LLM		OllamaChatModel or VertexAiGeminiChatModel
