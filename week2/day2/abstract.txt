There are two type of classes are there:
1. concrete classes
2. abstrcat classes


You can create the object of the concrete classes but you can not create the 
object of abstract classes
But you can create the reference of the abstract classes

abstract class and abstract method
A method which is not having any body is known as abstract method
must declare as abstract

If any class having atleast one abstract method it is known as abstract 
class
And a class is created abstract as if we declaring time

Class can be abstract without abstract methods

If a class is inherting from abstract class then it also become an abstract
to become concrete class it must override all the abstract class methods(parent class)
