// Object oriented Programming 4 major pillars

1. Abstraction:

It means hiding the details and showing the required things
for example a man driving a car while he focuses on using it rather than knowing
the inner mechanism of the car

2. Encapsulation:
It is the process of grouping the data in a single section

for example the complete television is single box where all the mechanism are hidden inside the 
box all are capusled

3. Inheritance

It means designing an object or a class by re using the properties of the existing
class and Object

Same as specialization

4. Polymorphism 

It means a concept which we can execute a single operation in differenet ways
It is same as Generalization


Class vs Objects

Object is defined in terms of properties and behaviour 
It will affect the properties
anything can be the object
