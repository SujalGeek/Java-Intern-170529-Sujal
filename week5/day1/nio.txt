Why we need the nio package?

We already have the package of io to read from file and write into the file
Basic reason is providing the multi threading capabilities in the nio library

Basically from using the nio package you can read the file from one thread and
write into the file from another thread so it is providing the multithreading
capabilities and non blocking capabilities

There are channels and buffers in the nio package
Data is always written from a buffer to a channel and read from channel to buffer

the selectors is an object that can be used for montioring the multiple channels
for events like data arrived and connection opened thus single thread can montior
multiple channel

The package helps when the application returns immediately whenever the data
avaliable and application should have pooling mechansim
