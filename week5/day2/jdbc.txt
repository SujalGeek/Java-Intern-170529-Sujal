JDBC is an API that helps communicate  with database it allows Java programs to 
connect with the database, queries and retrieve the database
It can easily work with different relational databases


JDBC Components
DriverManager Class
Conncection Interface
Statement and PreparedStatement Interfaces
Resultset Interface

-> DriverManager .. have many methods 
named method getconnection that connects with database
so then will have to store in the instance so that instance will be of Conncection
interface so when we need to connect with the database then need the instance of
connection interface 

Now when need to run the sql queries in Java the statment interface will helps
or PreparedStatement interface 

After running the SQL the query will returns the output the data is in form of 
result set so now then result set is need (result set means table )

So now in Java the result set is the interface so an instance will be created 
and that instance will be added to that table 

instance means object (so now result set interface instance will holding the table
return after performing the sql queries)


How the program flow
Connect with my IDE with the database using necessary connector
load necessary drivers 
create connection
create statment
exceute query
